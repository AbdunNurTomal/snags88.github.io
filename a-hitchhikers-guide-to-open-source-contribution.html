I mean, as a professional developer, I write enough code as already right?</p> <blockquote> <p>Wrong - <em>Donald Trump interrupting Hillary Clinton 50 times in a debate</em></p> </blockquote> <p>I like to think of it this way: if people didn’t spend anytime at all contributing to open source projects, let alone create them, then we’d all be solving the same problems over and over, while probably coming across the same gotchas and bugs. And if you really think about it, if we just solve the same set of problems, how can we move on to solving the harder and more complex problems of the world.</p> <p>Imagine I start learning how to program at the age of 18 and continue to hone my craft until I was 60, but never use open source libraries nor contributed to any. I would spend a large chunk of the time writing vanilla JS DOM selectors and manipulating the DOM directly, until eventually I figure out that storing state on the DOM is a bad idea. Or that when I interact with a database, it’s easier to model a row of data as an object, then eventually I might end up with my own ORM.</p> <p>Instead of worrying about that stuff, I can use libraries like React.js or ActiveRecord that solve those problems and focus on building a product that can address bigger problems.</p> <p>That kind of gets into my second point, which is that someone poured their sweat and tears into creating these open source libraries that allows you to do your job (or hobby) more efficiently. Would it not be the right thing to do to return that favor for the next young, budding developer? Pay it forward my friend.</p> <p>Lastly, I think contributing to open source projects builds empathy towards other devs and hopefully that extends to your other work. Because let’s be honest, developers aren’t known to be the most empathetic or understanding group of people.</p> <p>Ok rant over. Now for some more interesting, less opinionated part of the post…</p> <h2 id="how-to-do-it">How to do it?</h2> <p>Well there are a ton of open source projects out there so just on Github, randomly pick one and write some code.</p> <p>Just kidding.</p> <p>First thing is to <strong>start small and build confidence</strong> on your open source commits. Don’t let your first attempt be a commit to the Rails repo or jQuery. Pick a smaller library that you’re familiar with to get in the flow of things. I would even go as far as saying improve the documentation if you find it hard to understand or add some examples. The worst case scenario is that your pull request gets rejected for some legitimate reason and the best case is that you helped someone else undertand how to use this library.</p> <p>Second thing is to <strong>contribute to libraries you use</strong>. Most of the time, you will run into a limitation or pain point of the library and as an engineer, you find a solution for it. If that solution is applicable beyond the domain you’re working in, I bet it’s a good candiate to be added to the library. Remember, if you ran into this problem, chances are high that others will too! Help a brother (or sister) out!</p> <p>Third thing is to <strong>check the contribution guidelines on the README</strong> before you open a pull request. Each maintainer is different so in order to avoid friction and get your PR merged in, try to follow the rules he or she has set. Whether it’s writing a spec for your new code or updating the documentation, follow their guidlines!</p> <p>Fourth thing is to <strong>be clear about the problem you’re solving</strong>. Your PR is a great place to engage in dialogue with the maintainer or other devs. You might find some useful knowledge and more likely than not, if your PR isn’t ready to merge, they will tell you what’s wrong with it.</p> <p>Last thing: <strong>commit and prosper</strong>. You’ve done good for the world. Give yourself a pat and buy yourself an extra drink the next time you’re out at a bar.</p> <h2 id="example">Example</h2> <p>At work, we’ve been using a library called <a href="https://github.com/fetlife/rollout"><code class="highlighter-rouge">rollout</code></a> to manage feature flags. It has a lot of nice APIs, but I found a few convenience methods that were missing that I had added to our own instace of <code class="highlighter-rouge">rollout</code></p> <p>My first contribution to this library was literally adding an <code class="highlighter-rouge">#inactive?</code> method that returned <code class="highlighter-rouge">!active?</code>. You can see it <a href="https://github.com/fetlife/rollout/pull/86/files">here</a>.</p> <p>Yes. That simple.</p> <p>The next contribution I made was a little bit more complex, but I described the use case in the body of the PR, added specs for the new method, and voilà! <a href="https://github.com/fetlife/rollout/pull/90">My PR</a> was merged in.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>As a newish developer, I get stage fright knowing that my code will be scrutinized by experienced devs, but the more often you put your code out there, the better you get. We should all try to be helpful to each other and contribute to open source projects.</p> </div> </article> <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <ul class="social"> <li><a href="http://github.com/snags88" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-github"></i></a></li> <li><a href="http://linkedin.com/in/snaganuma" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-linkedin"></i></a></li> <li><a href="http://twitter.com/S2k10" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-twitter"></i></a></li> </ul> <p> <small>&copy;2018 All rights reserved.
