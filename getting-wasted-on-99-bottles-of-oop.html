Oh yes, I also finished the first 4 chapters of <a href="https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles/">99 Bottles of OOP</a> by Sandi Metz &amp; Katrina Owen so just want to jot down a few things I learned.</p> <h2 id="self-evaluation">Self-evaluation</h2> <p>There is a fun exercise at the very beginning of the book that every reader should attempt regardless of their experience. The directions for the exercise can be found <a href="https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles/sample/#appendix-exercise">here</a>. The exercise is test-driven and you should spend maybe like 30 minutes on it.</p> <p>The value of doing this exercise before getting too far into the book is that in the first chapter, the authors examine 4 different approaches to the exercise and determines the “best” solution based on a few criteria such as the information currently available and quantifiable metrics like ABC (assignments, branches, and conditions).</p> <p>I really liked this exercise for the simple fact that you get feedback on the code you write from a seasoned veteran like Sandi and Katrina. I mean it’s not a direct 1 on 1 code review session, but still, it’s great to get some sort of feedback. If you’re in a similar boat like me, where you know with some certainty what bad code looks like, but don’t quite know what great code looks like, this will be good for you.</p> <h2 id="yin--yang-of-changeability--understandability">Yin &amp; yang of changeability &amp; understandability</h2> <p>One of the points that Sandi and Katrina nail is that great code lies somewhere between extremely changeable and extremely understandable. There are some important ideas shared in this book like:</p> <ul> <li>Experienced programmers try to optimize for changeability because they have experienced code change before and their code loses understandability.</li> <li>Object-oriented design is making the right trade-offs to optimize flexibility and complexity.</li> <li>Great design is about picking the <strong>right abstractions at the right time</strong>. Don’t reach for the abstractions, let them present themselves in the code you write.</li> </ul> <p>What ended up happening for me while I went through the initial exercise was that after the first couple of tests, I was going down a path of writing clever code. About half way through, I took a step back and looked at my text editor and thought to myself “Where do I make my next change?”. That’s a bad sign when you wrote the code literally 5 minutes ago. Instead of continuing down this road, I gave up on DRY code for now and focused on getting the tests to pass. Which leads to the next point…</p> <h2 id="shameless-green">Shameless Green</h2> <p>I’ve been told to write tests for my code since day 1. But have I been doing that… mmm nope. In the first few months of being a developer, I was so overwhelmed with learning the domain, tools in our stack, and the processes on our engineering team, I didn’t really practice TDD. I’m here to tell you that’s ok. But don’t make it a habit.</p> <p>Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, let me just say the concept of shameless green is great. Write the specs for your code before you write anything, make your tests pass (turn green), then move on or refactor if the code you wrote is too shameful (at your own discretion). This is sort of a balancing act too in that you don’t want to litter your codebase with magic strings or repeated code all over the place. But at the same time, the authors make a great point in that the time you spend refactoring has an opportunity cost of you being able to work on other, more important matters.</p> <p>One thing I will say from my own experience is that learning how to TDD properly doesn’t happen overnight. Though I’ve gotten much better since I first started, I’m still working on my TDD skills. The one thing I’m most guilty of is writing code first then tests, which opens up your tests to know too much about the implementation of your code since you already wrote it. I think it requires a lot of practice to get it right so keep on writing those tests.</p> <h2 id="final-words">Final words…</h2> <p>There are way too many learning points in this book to list them all so I encourage you to read the book. I’m going to leave you with 2 of my favorite quotes from 99 Bottles of OOP:</p> <blockquote> <p>Writing code is the <em>process</em> of working your way to the next stable end point, not the end point itself. You don’t know the answer in advance, instead you are seeking it.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> <p>Code is read many more times than it is written. Writing code is like writing a book; your efforts are for <em>other</em> readers… Intention-revealing code is built from the accumulation of [such] thoughtful acts.</p> </blockquote> <p>I love that coding is a mental journey and you’re writing code not for yourself, but for others.</p> </div> </article> <footer class="site-footer"> <div class="container"> <ul class="social"> <li><a href="http://github.com/snags88" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-github"></i></a></li> <li><a href="http://linkedin.com/in/snaganuma" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-linkedin"></i></a></li> <li><a href="http://twitter.com/S2k10" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-twitter"></i></a></li> </ul> <p> <small>&copy;2018 All rights reserved.
